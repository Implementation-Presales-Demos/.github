## ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome to the Implementation Demo's GitHub Organization

## The What's and the Why's

THis organization is home to all the wonderful IM built demo's built to show off to our merchants the features and flows that are possible with Adyen. While an official Adyen demo is in the works, we see that there is a need for IM's to make quick spin ups of working features to prove to merchants what is possible.

## Guidelines for contribution

Each demo in this orgnaization is the result of the hard work, care and love of the individuals and teams that have built them. 
You may visit any of individual repsositories and follow the link to the official hosted site to explore how it works.

iF you find that there is a fetaure that would be really great for the demo that isn't currently available, please request this to the owners of the respository by opening an issue.

Please follow the following rules

1. Do not contribute directly to the main or master branch
2. Contribute instead to the develop branch
3. Switch to develop branch
4. When working on a new feature, create a new branch from the develop branch (see naming convention below) and create a pull request to the develop branch

## Branch Naming Convention
When creating a branch, use the naming convention @name followed by /subject ie: @luke/chatbot_stuff

## Presales Demo
