## Hello ðŸ‘‹ ..and Welcome to the Implementation Demos GitHub Organization

This organization is home to all the wonderful IM-built demos, created to show off all the features and flows, to our merchants, that are possible with Adyen. While an official Adyen demo is in the works, we see that there is always need for IM's to dabble with code and make quick spin ups of working features to prove to our merchants what is possible.
You may visit any of individual repsositories and follow the link to demo site

## Contributing

Each demo in this organization is the result of the hard work, care and love of the individuals and teams that have built them. Please respect them by following the guidelines
listed here.

iF you think of a feature that would be really great for the demo which isn't currently available, please request this to the owners of the respository by opening an issue.

Please follow the following rules

1. Do not contribute directly to the main or master branch
2. Contribute instead to the develop branch
3. Switch to develop branch
4. When working on a new feature, create a new branch from the develop branch (see naming convention below) and create a pull request to the develop branch
